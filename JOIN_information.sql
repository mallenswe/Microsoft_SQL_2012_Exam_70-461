/*
	JOINS: Retrieve data from more than one table.
			- Normalization: Design methodology of organizing tables of a relational database to minimize redundancy and dependency
				- Makes data management more efficient
				- Makes retrieving data a bit more challenging
			- Structure: SELECT, FROM, TableA AS a JOIN TableB AS b ON a.ID = b.ID
				- NOTE:
					- TableA is the left table (on the left side of the JOIN keyword)
					- TableB is the right table (on the right side of the JOIN keyword)
					- We are using table aliasing (similar to column aliasing)
